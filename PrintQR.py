# Main script for Adafruit Internet of Things Printer 2.  Monitors button
# for taps and holds, performs periodic actions (Twitter polling by default)
# and daily actions (Sudoku and weather by default).
# Written by Adafruit Industries.  MIT license.
#
# MUST BE RUN AS ROOT (due to GPIO access)
#
# Required software includes Adafruit_Thermal, Python Imaging and PySerial
# libraries. Other libraries used are part of stock Python install.
